## Little Red Riding Hood

*II*
The wolf ran as fast as his paws could carry him. He jumped over roots, slipped between trees, until at last he saw a small house with a chimney and a garden full of flowers.

“This must be the place,” he hissed with a smile.

He knocked softly on the door.

“Who’s there?” came Grandma’s weak voice.

“It’s me, Little Red Riding Hood,” said the wolf, pretending to be the girl with a sweet, tiny voice. “I brought you some cake and juice!”

“Oh, come in, my dear!” Grandma called out happily.

The wolf opened the door, leapt inside, and swallowed Grandma in one gulp!

Then he looked around the room, tied Grandma’s scarf around his head, put on her glasses, and lay down in bed.

“Now I’ll just wait for the little one,” he murmured, pulling the blanket up to his chin.

A moment later, quiet footsteps and cheerful humming could be heard in the forest. It was Little Red Riding Hood, who had found the path again and was walking toward Grandma’s house.

She knocked politely on the door.

“Grandma, it’s me! I brought you some cake and juice!”

“Come in, my dear,” answered the wolf, again pretending to be Grandma.

Little Red Riding Hood entered the room. It was dark inside. She walked closer to the bed.

“Grandma, what big ears you have!” she said, surprised.

“All the better to hear you with, my child,” said the wolf.

“And what big eyes you have!”

“All the better to see you with.”

“And what big teeth you have!” squeaked the girl.

“All the better to eat you with!” roared the wolf, and with one big jump he swallowed Little Red Riding Hood whole!

Then he licked his lips happily, lay down comfortably in the bed, and murmured:

“Ah, what a delicious dinner… Now it’s time for a nap.”

And he fell asleep right away, snoring loudly under Grandma’s blanket.
