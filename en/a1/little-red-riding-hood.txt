<div class="x-dropcap" style="--dropcap-color: #901">^^Once upon a time^^, there lived a little girl whom everyone called Little Red Riding Hood, because she often wore a red hood. She lived with her mom and dad and was so kind that everyone liked her.

One day, her mom said, “Sweetheart, Grandma is sick. Take her this basket with cake and juice. But go straight along the forest path and don’t talk to strangers, okay?”

“Okay, Mommy,” replied the girl. She took the basket and went to Grandma’s.

She was walking peacefully through the forest. Suddenly she saw red, juicy berries and really wanted to eat them. She picked one, then another, a third… and soon forgot about the path behind her.

She went deeper and deeper into the forest.

Suddenly… the wolf appeared!

“Where are you going, little girl?” he asked, trying to speak in a nice voice.

“I’m going to Grandma’s,” answered Little Red Riding Hood. “Grandma is sick. I’m bringing her cake and juice.”

“Ohhh, that’s very nice,” said the wolf and smiled. “And where does Grandma live?”

“In a little house, behind the big oak, at the end of the path.”

“Well, well…” said the wolf, his soft voice full of concern, yet his eyes gleaming with delight. “A lonely, sick Grandma… what a pity.”

The girl looked at him with slight unease.

“Mommy said not to talk to strangers,” she added.

“Of course, Mommy is right!” the wolf smiled. “I just… like to help. Maybe I’ll visit your granny too. I wish her good health!”

And before Little Red Riding Hood could say anything, the wolf disappeared into the bushes. He ran quickly, taking a shortcut, because he knew the forest well. He wanted to reach Grandma’s house first.

The wolf ran as fast as his paws could carry him, jumping over bushes and slipping between trees, until at last he saw a small house with a chimney and a garden full of flowers.

“This must be the place,” he hissed with a smile.

He knocked softly on the door.

“Who’s there?” came Grandma’s weak voice.

“It’s me, Little Red Riding Hood,” said the wolf, pretending to be the girl with a sweet, tiny voice. “I brought you some cake and juice!”

“Oh, come in, come in, my dear!” Grandma called out happily.

The wolf opened the door, leapt inside, and swallowed Grandma in one gulp!

Then he looked around the room, tied Grandma’s scarf around his head, put on her glasses, and lay down in bed.

“Now I’ll just wait for the little one,” he murmured, pulling the blanket up to his chin.

A moment later, quiet footsteps and cheerful humming could be heard in the forest. It was Little Red Riding Hood, who had found the path again and was walking toward Grandma’s house.

She knocked politely on the door.

“Grandma, it’s me! I brought you some cake and juice!”

“Come in, my dear,” answered the wolf, again pretending to be Grandma.

Little Red Riding Hood entered the room. It was dark inside. She walked closer to the bed.

“Grandma, what big ears you have!” she said, surprised.

“All the better to hear you with, my child,” said the wolf.

“And what big eyes you have!”

“All the better to see you with, my dear,” grinned the wolf.

“And what BIG TEETH you have!” cried the girl in shock.

“All the better to EAT you with!” roared the wolf, and with one big jump he swallowed Little Red Riding Hood whole!

Then he licked his lips happily, lay down comfortably in the bed, and murmured:

“Ah, what a delicious dinner… Now it’s time for a nap.”

And he fell asleep right away, snoring loudly under Grandma’s blanket.


<h3 class="center">III</h3>
Just then, a huntsman happened to pass by Grandma's house. He heard a loud snoring sound and thought it was rather strange.

“Hmmm, something’s not quite right here,” he muttered. “I better check on Grandma.”

He walked up to the door.

“Hello?” he called softly, knocking twice, but there was no answer. Carefully, he pushed the door open and stepped inside. His eyes widened when he saw the wolf, curled up under the blanket in Grandma's bed, snoring heavily. The wolf’s belly looked big and round... and it was ~moving~!

The huntsman knew he had to act fast. With one quick movement, he pulled off the blanket. The belly twitched and wobbled — as though someone was trapped inside. 

“Time to help whoever's in there!” the huntsman said quietly.

He drew his sharp knife and carefully cut open the wolf’s belly. Out jumped Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood, both safe and sound, though quite shaken.

“Oh Grandma!” cried Little Red Riding Hood, hugging her tightly. “We’re safe!”

Grandma kissed her and smiled through tears. “Thank you, dear huntsman! You saved us both!”

The huntsman tipped his hat with a chuckle. “Just doing my job, ma’am. I’m glad I happened to be in the right place at the right time!”

From that day on, Little Red Riding Hood never forgot her mother’s words: ~Always stay on the path and never talk to strangers.~ 

As for the wolf, well, kind Grandma took pity on him and sewed up his belly. Ashamed, he promised to behave and cause no more harm. With that, he trotted back into the forest... never to be seen again.
