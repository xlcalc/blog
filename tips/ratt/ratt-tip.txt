0:0 Learning a new language can sometimes be frustrating, especially when you keep making the same mistakes even though you know the rules. You might feel annoyed or even embarrassed, and I completely understand and respect those feelings. But let’s pause for a moment. What could you do when you get stuck in frustration? A surprisingly smart creature can help you out: the rat.

Rats are incredibly intelligent. When they face a problem, they don’t waste time feeling defeated — they get busy finding a solution. So, how can this help you with language learning? Simple: when your teacher corrects you, think of the rat and *Repeat After The Teacher (RATT)*.

It’s a quick, effective trick. Next time you’re corrected, don’t dwell on the mistake — RATT it out and keep moving forward!
